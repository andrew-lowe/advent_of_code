# advent of code

Working through Advent of Code with the primary goal of getting reps in Rust.

I copied the directory structure and daily automation scripts from [Christopher Biscardi](https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/advent-of-code/tree/860e903fa81d85e7f28676923774b50677e311ab) -- thank you Christopher!
